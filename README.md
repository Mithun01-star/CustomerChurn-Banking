## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Problem Statement:**  
  This model aims to predict whether a customer will stay or leave (churn) from a bank based on various input parameters, helping the bank take proactive actions.

- **Dataset:**  
  The dataset can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y1S5iSLTLhgBZ5dR0BpaJ2ZW--76ql6S/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=115397232623205220901&rtpof=true&sd=true). It contains information about customers' demographics, account details, and service usage. The target variable is whether the customer will leave (churn) or stay.

- **Goal:**  
  The goal of this project is to accurately predict customer churn, which will enable banks to reduce churn by focusing on customers who are likely to leave.
